# Runme Governance

## Maintainers

The project is governed by its [maintainers](./MAINTAINERS.md). The **Lead Maintainer** is Sebastian (Tiedtke) Huckleberry ([@sourishkrout](https://github.com/sourishkrout)), who has tie-breaking authority on decisions that cannot reach consensus.

## Decision-Making

Decisions are made by **lazy consensus** among maintainers. If consensus cannot be reached, a vote is called:

- Each maintainer gets one vote.
- A **simple majority** is required to pass.
- The Lead Maintainer casts the tie-breaking vote if needed.

## Becoming a Maintainer

New maintainers are proposed by an existing maintainer and approved by a **majority vote** of current maintainers. Maintainers are expected to actively contribute to the project through code, reviews, or community engagement.

## Removing a Maintainer

A maintainer may step down voluntarily at any time. Removal of an inactive or non-compliant maintainer requires a **two-thirds (2/3) vote** of the remaining maintainers.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations should be reported per the procedures described there.

## Changes to Governance

Amendments to this governance document require a **two-thirds (2/3) vote** of all current maintainers.
