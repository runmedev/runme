 NotebookService defines methods the AI can use to interact with the notebook.
 This is used to generate JSON schemas that can be used to define tool calls (or potentially) MCP
 server. Using https://github.com/redpanda-data/protoc-gen-go-mcp.

 use the script api/proto/agent/tools/v1/build_tool_mcps.sh to build the go code with the JSONSchemas.

 It looks like only comments on the method get translated into the description.

 TODO(jlewi): We should make it UpdateCells to allow the model to update multiple cells in a
 single call.
